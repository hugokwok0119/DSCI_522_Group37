# Breast Cancer Predictor

  - Authors:  Sameel Syed, Hoi Hin Kwok, Lavanya Gupta & Yusheng Li

This project is made as the Group Project for group 37 as the data analysis project for 
DSCI 522 (Data Science Workflows); as the part of requirements in a course in the Master 
of Data Science program at the University 
of British Columbia.

## About

Here we attempt to build a Breast Cancer classification model using the SVC 
algorithm which can use breast cancer tumour image 
measurements to predict whether a newly discovered breast cancer tumour 
is benign (i.e., is not harmful and does not require treatment) or 
malignant (i.e., is harmful and requires treatment intervention). 
Our final classifier performed fairly well on an unseen test data set, 
with an overall accuracy calculated to be 0.99. On the 114 test data cases, 
it correctly predicted 113. 
It incorrectly predicted 1 case, predicting that a tumour is benign 
when in fact it is actually malignant. 
These kind of incorrect predictions could cause the patient 
to miss out on necessary treatment, 
and as such we recommend further research to improve the model 
before it is ready to be put into production in the clinic.

The data set that was used in this project is of digitized breast cancer
image features created by Dr. William H. Wolberg, W. Nick Street, and
Olvi L. Mangasarian at the University of Wisconsin, Madison (Street,
Wolberg, and Mangasarian 1993). It was sourced from the UCI Machine
Learning Repository (Dua and Graff 2017) and can be found
[here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+\(Diagnostic\)),
specifically [this
file](http://mlr.cs.umass.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/breast-cancer-wisconsin/wdbc.data).
Each row in the data set represents summary statistics from measurements
of an image of a tumour sample, including the diagnosis (benign or
malignant) and several other measurements (e.g., nucleus texture,
perimeter, area, etc.). Diagnosis for each image was conducted by
physicians.

## Dependencies
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) 
- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
- [VS Code Jupyter Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-toolsai.jupyter)

## Usage

### Setup

> If you are using a Windows or Mac PC, make sure Docker Desktop is running.

1. Please clone this GitHub repository.

### Running the analysis

1. Navigate to the root of this project on your computer using the
   command line and enter the following command:

``` 
docker compose up
```

2. In the terminal, look for a URL that starts with 
`http://127.0.0.1:8888/lab?token=` 
(for an example, see the highlighted text in the terminal below). 
Copy and paste that URL into your browser.

3. To run the analysis now,
open `src/breast_cancer_predict_report.ipynb` in Jupyter Lab you just launched
and under the "Kernel" menu click "Restart Kernel and Run All Cells...".

### Clean up

1. To shut down the container and clean up the resources, 
type `Cntrl` + `C` in the terminal
where you launched the container, and then type `docker compose rm`

## Developer notes

### Developer dependencies
- `conda` (version 23.9.0 or higher)
- `conda-lock` (version 2.5.7 or higher)

### Adding any new dependency

1. Add the new dependency to the `environment.yml` file on a new branch.

2. Run `conda-lock -k explicit --file environment.yml -p linux-64` to update the `conda-linux-64.lock` file.

2. Ensure to re-build the Docker image locally to ensure it builds and runs properly.

3. Push the made changes to GitHub. A new Docker
   image will be built and pushed to Docker Hub automatically.
   It will be tagged with the SHA for the commit that changed the file.

4. Update the `docker-compose.yml` file on your branch to use the new
   container image (make sure to update the tag specifically).

5. Send a pull request to merge the changes into the `main` branch.
